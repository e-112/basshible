# Exploration project

What would it take to have an equivalent to Ansible\*, but:

- being developed in plain Bash
- not using YAML for playbook, but also Bash

because Bash should be enough, right?

\* This project is just a frustation driven exploration after attempting to use Ansible for simple management tasks.
It began with the realisation that I am a happy caveman with only Bash and SSH.
